Name:
myshell - Python shell which execute several builtins and your system's binary.

Synopsis:
myshell [commandsFile]

Description:
myshell is a scholar project, the aim is to produce a functional shell with commands executions, some builtins, redirection and background execution.

Background Execution:
The char '&' is used to perform a background execution. If the user put it at the end of the command, the shell will not wait for the end of the command to continue its execution.

Redirection:
This shell implement three redirection. Redirection are used like that: <Cmd> <args> [redirection] [fileName]
If the user need to give command arguments and this command arguments are in a file, he can use the left redirection (<) for that and the content of the file will be used as user input.
To save the output of a command or a builtin in a file, the user can use the right redirection. The simple (>) to create a file and write the output on the top of the file and the double (>>) to append the output at the end of the file.
